          "a": "No. Lovart no longer requires a Lovart invitation code of any kind. The Lovart invitation code system was retired when the platform moved to a full public launch in 2025. Any user can register at lovart.ai without a Lovart invitation code, a referral link, or a waitlist. Simply create a free account and start designing instantly."

          "a": "During the private beta phase, existing users shared a personal Lovart invitation code with friends. New users joined a waitlist and received a Lovart invitation code by email once a slot opened. Some Lovart invitation codes also circulated in AI tool communities. The invitation code era helped Lovart build a curated early-adopter community before the public launch."

          "a": "Yes. Lovart's free plan requires only an email address — no Lovart invitation code, no credit card, and no referral is needed. The free tier gives immediate access to AI design generation. Paid plans (Basic and Pro) unlock the Nano Banana model, unlimited generation credits, and priority rendering, all without any invitation code restriction."

          "a": "Lovart's beta program evolved through three phases: a closed alpha, an invite-only beta where a Lovart invitation code was required, and an open beta with a waitlist. After the open beta proved stable and well-received, the team removed all entry barriers. Today Lovart operates as a fully launched product. The Lovart invitation code restriction was one of the last beta-era limitations to be lifted."
